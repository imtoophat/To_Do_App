*Application Use*
------------------

The purpose of our application is to help our stakeholders to track and visualize their day-to-day productivity by tracking the time it takes for them to complete their tasks in order to help with time management.

*Stakeholders and Application Users*
------------------
Students:
They can easily track their time spent on various classes, and compare effort required by each class.
This data can be shared with future students to better help plan schedules.

Professionals:
They can easily track the time they spend both at work, on a particular project, or at home on personal projects, chores, and other task    categories.
They are then able to budget their time more effectively in the future, knowing this data.

*How to use the system*
------------------

The To Do Items tag on the left side of the screen will see a To Do Name, Tag Name, and Stopwatch Input when they load the application. These buttons allow users to add an item name (ex. homework assignment 1), a tag name (ex. INST377), and to start a timer when they begin their task and to stop the timer once they have completed it.

Once the user is done with recording the time of an item, they can click submit button, which transfers the data to the Tracking Results column on the right, which summarizes the time taken for that particular item under their tag.

If users want to remove a specific item, they can click the 'x' associated with that particular item, and it will remove it along with the Tracking Results.
